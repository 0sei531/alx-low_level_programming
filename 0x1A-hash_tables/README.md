1. What is a hash function?

A hash function is a function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code. The output, or hash value, is commonly a digest of the input data, and even a small change in the input should produce a significantly different hash value. Hash functions are widely used in computer science for various applications, including data integrity verification, password storage, and hash tables.

2. What makes a good hash function?

A good hash function should have the following properties:

Deterministic: The same input should always produce the same hash output.
Efficient: The computation of the hash value should be fast and efficient.
Uniform Distribution: Hash values should be uniformly distributed across the output space to minimize collisions.
Preimage Resistance: It should be computationally infeasible to reverse the hash function and obtain the original input.
Avalanche Effect: A small change in the input should result in a significantly different hash value.
Collision Resistance: It should be difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.
3. What is a hash table, how do they work, and how to use them?

A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices, allowing for efficient data retrieval. Here's a basic overview of how they work:

Initialization: Create an array (hash table) of a certain size.
Hashing: Use a hash function to convert each key into an index in the array.
Storage: Store the key-value pair in the array at the determined index.
Retrieval: To retrieve a value, apply the hash function to the key, go to the corresponding index, and retrieve the stored value.
Hash tables provide constant-time average-case complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them efficient for many applications.

4. What is a collision, and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table?

A collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. Common collision resolution techniques include:

Separate Chaining: Each table entry is a linked list. Collisions are resolved by appending elements to the linked list at the corresponding index.

Open Addressing: All elements are stored in the array itself. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot.

5. What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables?

Advantages:

Efficiency: Hash tables provide constant-time average-case complexity for basic operations.
Dynamic Size: Hash tables can dynamically resize to accommodate changes in the number of elements.
Versatility: Suitable for various applications, such as databases, caches, and symbol tables.
Drawbacks:

Collisions: Collisions can degrade performance, and the choice of collision resolution strategy is crucial.
Deterministic Sizing: Resizing operations can be costly, and the table may need to be resized periodically.
Hash Function Sensitivity: The effectiveness of a hash table can depend on the quality of the hash function used.
6. What are the most common use cases of hash tables?

Data Retrieval: Efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
Symbol Tables: Used in compilers and interpreters to store variables and their values.
Caching: Hash tables are used to implement caches, storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
Databases: Hash indexes in databases provide fast access to records based on keys.
Security: Hash functions are used in password hashing for secure storage.
Hash tables are versatile data structures employed in various domains where quick data access and retrieval are crucial.
