#0x08. C - Recursion
C functions may be used recursively; that is, a function may call itself either directly or 
indirectly. Consider printing a number as a character string. As we mentioned before, the 
digits are generated in the wrong order: low-order digits are available before high-order digits, 
but they have to be printed the other way around.
