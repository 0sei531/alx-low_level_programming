Definition:
A dynamic library (or shared library) is a compiled binary file containing code and data that can be loaded into a program's memory during runtime. It allows multiple programs to share a single copy of the library, reducing redundancy and improving memory efficiency.

How it works:
Dynamic linking allows a program to call functions or use data from a dynamic library at runtime. The library is loaded into the program's address space by the operating system when needed. This facilitates code reuse and enables updates to the library without recompiling the programs using it.
