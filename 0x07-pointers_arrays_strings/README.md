#0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
In C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays, strong enough that pointers 
and arrays should be discussed simultaneously. Any operation that can be achieved by array 
subscripting can also be done with pointers. The pointer version will in general be faster but, 
at least to the uninitiated, somewhat harder to understand.
