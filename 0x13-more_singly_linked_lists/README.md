A linked list is an example of an abstract data structure. 
Itâ€™s called an abstract data structure because a linked list is 
general: it can be used to store a lot of different kinds of data.
To understand how a linked list works, think back to our tour 
company. A linked list stores a piece of data, and a link to 
another piece of data.
